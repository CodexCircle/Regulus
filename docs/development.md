# Development

Requirements: Go 1.26+, Node.js 22+.

```sh
make build            # builds the dashboard, then bin/regulus
./bin/regulus hub     # serves the dashboard on :8080
make test             # go vet, go test -race, dashboard typecheck and tests
make lint             # golangci-lint and ESLint
make smoke            # start bin/regulus and check it end to end (after make build)
scripts/test-install.sh   # tests of the install script (also part of make test)
```

For dashboard work, run `npm run dev` in `dashboard/` (proxies `/api` to the hub on `:8080`).
